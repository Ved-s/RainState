# RainState
A tool created for editing Rain World save files (and similar files, like options and arena session)

Files can be edited manually with tree-like editor or, if known file type is opened, some its parts can be edited with user-friendly UI.

### Current editor progress

Full list of arena unlocks, sandbox unlocks and challenge classes
Full list of lore pearls and broadcasts
More Slugcats unlocks (slugcat completions)

Warning! Safari unlocks are still broken, they can break Arena menu
